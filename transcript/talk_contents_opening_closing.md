## Opening


#### Greeting
Good morning everyone. 

#### Affliation
This is Yusuke Niitani from Department of Creative Informatics at The University of Tokyo.


#### Topic Library
Today, I am going to talk about a deep learning library for computer vision, which is a collection of tools and reference implementations and acceralate your research in Computer Vision.


#### Map
First of all, I'd like to talk about brief overview of our computer vision library.

Next, I'd like to talk about two main features of our software.
The first feature is to provide off-the shelf implementations of algorithms.
The second feature is to provide tools and base implementations to train neural networks.


#### Time
My presentation lasts for ten minutes.

#### Questions
If you have questions, please hold it until end of my speech.




## Closing

#### Summary

In my presentation, I, first, talked about overview of our software and its relationship with other deep learning libraries.

After that, I presented two features.
First, the library provides off-the shelf implementations of algorithms, which include some of the state of the art algorithms like SSD.

Seconde, the library provides tools and baseline implementations to train neural networks that are helpful for users who want to train on their own datasets.

#### Conclusion
In conclusion, we developed a computer vision software library specifically targeted to deep learning.
We believe that our library will be useful to rapidly test and experiment new ideas.
