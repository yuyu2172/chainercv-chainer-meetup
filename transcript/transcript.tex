We should have a good abstraction that groups together similar functions to have the similar interface.
We analyzed a common procedure to train a computer vision network,
 and identified it to be composed of six elements:
 data loading, data preprocessing, CNN, weight update, visualization, and evaluation.
So, for example, an evaluation function takes list of predictions and ground truth, and returns measured score such as IoU in the case of semantic segmentation.
